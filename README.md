# PricingTest
A company sells a software for 39. Since revenue has been ﬂat for some time, the VP of Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price (39), while a random sample of 33% users a higher price (59).

The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.

This analysis is trying to answer three questions:
1. Should the company sell its software for 39 or 59?
2. The VP of Product is interested in having a holistic view into user behavior, especially focusing on actionable insights that might increase conversion rate. What are the main ﬁndings looking at the data?
3. The VP of Product feels that the test has been running for too long and he should have been able to get statistically signiﬁcant results in a shorter time. Do you agree with her intuition? After how many days you would have stopped the test? Please, explain why.
